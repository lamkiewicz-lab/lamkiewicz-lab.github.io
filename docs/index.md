# Welcome

You found your way to our little webpage. We are the Analytical MicroBioinformatics group (aka LamkiewiczLab) located at the [FSU Jena](https://www.uni-jena.de/en).
We are further associated with the [RNA Bioinformatics and High-Throughput Analysis](https://www.rna.uni-jena.de/) group, led by Prof. Dr. Manja Marz.  

The Analytical MicroBioinformatics group is a newly formed sub-group, which is led by [Kevin Lamkiewicz](people/kevin.md).
 Utilizing existing tools and workflows and developing our own if needed, we aim to derive rules and models for critical molecular mechanisms that occur during an infection of a host with a pathogen. The main focus is on (eukaryotic) viruses; however, we are generally interested in any pathogen-host-interaction.  
We apply large-scale comparisons of genome sequences, RNA secondary structures, protein structures, and their interactions (e.g., RNA-RNA interaction, RNA-Protein interaction) and always strive to back up our findings with biological data.
